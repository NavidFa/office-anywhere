So you're starting a new feature...

1) $ git pull upstream master (make sure your code is up to date with the OSoT)

2) $ git checkout -b <feature-branch-name> (create a new branch for your new feature)

3) do stuff until feature is completed

4) $ git pull upstream master

5) $ git add
   $ git commit -m ''
   $ git push origin <feature-branch-name> (this is the same branch name you created in step 2)

6) go to your github repo and open a pull request to the OSoT master branch

7) if approved, your work will be merged into the OSoT master branch

8) delete feature-branch-name locally

9) repeat until death!
